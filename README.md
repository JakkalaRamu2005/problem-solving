# My Problem Solving Journey 🚀

Welcome to my code repository! This is where I upload the code I write while learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 

I started this journey as a complete beginner. My goal is to practice every day, improve my logic, and become a great problem solver.

## 📂 Repository Structure

I have organized my code into different folders to keep it clean:

*   **`c++`**: This folder contains my practice code organized by topics.
    *   Arrays
    *   Linked Lists
    *   Recursion
    *   Sorting & Searching
    *   Strings
    *   STL Concepts (Standard Template Library)
    *   And more...

*   **`codingplatform`**: Here you can find my solutions to problems from online platforms:
    *   **LeetCode**
    *   **Codeforces**

*   **`daily-coding`**: I try to code consistently. This folder has my daily practice files, sorted by month (e.g., `nov-2025`, `dec`, etc.).

*   **`python`**: I also practice Python. This folder has my Python scripts and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) practice.

## 🛠️ Languages Used

*   **C++**: My main language for DSA and competitive programming.
*   **Python**: For flexible scripting and learning concepts.

## 🎯 My Goal

I want to master DSA and be able to solve complex coding problems with confidence. I update this repo regularly as I learn new things.
